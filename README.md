# ImageNEST
The ImageNEST function is the root of this program. The runGauntlet program has several precoded instances of ImageNEST. 
ImageNEST can process images in the 'images' folder by using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm called Nested Sampling to 
converge on optimum Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for several property histograms of the given image (Y',U,V,Horizontal-Shape,
Vertical-Shape). It will output several graphs detailing the work done by the program along with a readout. Several images have 
been processed and their figures/results have been saved into the 'green-triangle', 'blackcircle', and 'television' folders 
respectively.
